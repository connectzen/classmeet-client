# Push After Changes

After completing code changes to this project, always push to the remote repository:

1. **Client changes** (in `client/`): Run from `client/` directory:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"`
   - `git push`

2. **Server changes** (in `server/`): Run from `server/` directory:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"`
   - `git push`

3. **Both changed**: Push each repository separately (client and server are separate git repos).
