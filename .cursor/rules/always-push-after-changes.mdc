# Always Push After Changes

**IMPORTANT**: After making any code changes to this project, you MUST:

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "..."`
3. Push to the remote: `git push`

Apply this for both the `client` and `server` repositories (they are separate git repos). Push each one after editing files in that directory.
